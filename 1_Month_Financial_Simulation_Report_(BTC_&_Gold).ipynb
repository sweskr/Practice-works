        "\n",
        "**Overview**\n",
        "This report provides a Monte Carlo-based simulation of the one-month price outlook for Bitcoin (BTC) and Gold, using historical data from the past 30 trading days. The goal was to model the future price distribution using the Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) framework, widely applied in financial forecasting.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Methodology**\n",
        "The simulation utilized daily closing prices for BTC and Gold obtained from Yahoo Finance, along with CPI data from FRED. The log returns of both assets were computed and used to derive the expected annualized returns and volatilities. The GBM model assumes that asset prices follow a stochastic exponential growth model characterized by a constant drift (mean return) and volatility.\n",
        "\n",
        "For each asset, 5,000 simulation paths were generated over a 30-day forecast horizon, representing one trading month. The random shocks used in these simulations were drawn from a standard normal distribution, and drift/volatility parameters were calibrated from historical data.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Results**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Bitcoin (BTC):**\n",
        "The expected one-month return was 1.46%, with a 5% worst-case outcome (Value at Risk) of -30.94%. The 95% best-case scenario suggested potential gains up to 41.76%. The probability of BTC delivering a positive return over the forecast period was estimated at 48.08%.\n",
        "\n",
        "Gold:\n",
        "Gold displayed a mean return of 4.94%, with a far more limited downside of -3.55% at the 5% tail and an upside potential of 13.83%. The probability of a positive return was 82.68%, indicating a strong risk-adjusted outlook.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Analysis**\n",
        "The simulation highlights the classic behavior of these two assets: Bitcoin remains a highly volatile, speculative instrument with extreme return distribution, while Gold shows stability and consistent performance. Bitcoin’s broad return distribution is reflected in both its upside and downside volatility, with a Sharpe ratio below 0.3. Gold, on the other hand, exhibits a high Sharpe ratio (>2.7), driven by its steady returns and low volatility.\n",
        "\n",
        "The win probability metric—indicating how often returns were positive across simulations—further underscores Gold’s dominance as a short-term safe haven. BTC’s 48% win rate resembles a coin flip, while Gold’s 82% probability suggests strong predictability and reliability in the short term.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Conclusion**\n",
        "This Monte Carlo simulation indicates that over the next month, investors seeking higher certainty and capital preservation may benefit from Gold exposure. Bitcoin continues to offer higher risk/reward dynamics but comes with elevated downside risk. These results are consistent with traditional asset allocation insights and reinforce the importance of balancing riskier assets with stable stores of value like Gold."
